# Financial Data Analytics Platform

## Overview
The Financial Data Analytics Platform leverages data science and machine learning to analyze sectoral financial trends using data from the SEC EDGAR database. This project demonstrates how to transform raw financial data into actionable insights for stakeholders such as investors, policymakers, and business leaders.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Automates data curation and storage using Python and MongoDB.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizes insights with Tableau, highlighting trends, profitability, and risks.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements predictive analysis to forecast market trends and evaluate company performance.
- **Summarization with LLMs**: Uses OpenAI GPT models for summarizing complex 10-K filings.

## Objectives
1. Analyze financial data trends across sectors (e.g., Technology, Finance, Healthcare).
2. Identify correlations between profitability, risk, and research investments.
3. Present insights through interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Data Source
- **SEC EDGAR Database**: Financial filings of publicly traded U.S. companies.


## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Libraries**: pandas, BeautifulSoup, LangChain
- **APIs**: SEC EDGAR API
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Statistical Testing
